 
This file gives the empirical power for the generalized
normal scores (GNS) test that is described in the manuscript:

O'Gorman, T. W. (2020) A Generalized Normal Scores Test of Significance
for any Coefficient in a Linear Model. (Submitted for publication.)

In each of these simulations 1000 data sets were generated and the
traditional t-test and the GNS test were used to test the null hypothesis
that the last parameter in the model equals zero, against the two-sided
alternative that the parameter does not equal zero.

Notation:

alpha = 0.05 was used as the nominal level of significance for all tests.
"n of permutations" was not used in this simulation.
rho   = the correlation between two covariates in the model.
ic    = the number of parameters in the full model.
icred = number of parameters in the reduced model.
n     = number of observations.
"Distribution" is the distribution of the errors that were generated.
"t" the traditional t test
"Adaptive" is the adaptive test described in O'Gorman, T. W. (2012)
"Permwts" is a permute weights test described by 
          O'Gorman, T. W. in an unpublished manuscript.
"GNS" is the generalized normal scores test 
"GNS-t" is the level of significance for the GNS test minus that of the t test
